arc-theme (20190917-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New upstream release
    - Allow builds against gnome-shell 3.34
    - Refactor gnome-shell 3.32 code
        Removes redundant selectors/styling (i.e. styling that is no longer
        required in newer gnome shell versions), and replaces with newer
        selectors/styling (modifying to match Arc styling where necessary)
        Integrates styling from the default gnome shell theme into the Arc
        shell theme. Because the user shell theme (Arc in this case) is
        "overlaid" over the default shell theme, this is styling that was
        being "pulled in" anyway.
        Add full shadows to panel dropdown menus
    - InfoBar colors should respect type
    - Remove border from stackswitcher
    - Don't hardcode LightDM font-size
    - XFCE 4.14 panel styling fixes
  * Packaging Changes
    - Control: Update VCS fields for upstream name change
    - Control & Compat: Bump StandardsVersion - no changes required
    - Control: dependency update gnome-themes-extra (Closes: #892033)

    - upstream/metadata: Update for upstream name change
    - upstream/signing-key.asc: Update for maintainer signing key
    - watch: update for upstream name change
